# CI/CD Workflow Definitions

This directory contains CI/CD workflow definitions using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
These workflows cover testing and deployment of ML code, Databricks bundle resources (models, experiments, apps), and infrastructure.

## Active Workflows

### Core MLOps Workflows

1. **agentops_dev-bundle-ci.yml** - Bundle validation on PRs
   - Triggers: Pull requests, manual dispatch
   - Validates bundle configuration for staging and prod targets
   - Runs on PR to ensure bundle is valid before merge

2. **agentops_dev-bundle-cd-staging.yml** - Continuous deployment to staging
   - Triggers: Push to `main` branch (any changes), manual dispatch
   - Deploys bundle to staging environment
   - Includes models, experiments, jobs, and app deployment

3. **agentops_dev-bundle-cd-prod.yml** - Production deployment
   - Triggers: Manual dispatch only
   - Deploys bundle to production environment
   - Requires manual approval for safety

4. **agentops_dev-run-tests.yml** - Run tests
   - Triggers: Pull requests, manual dispatch
   - Executes test suite to validate changes

5. **lint-cicd-workflow-files.yml** - Workflow linting
   - Triggers: Pull requests affecting workflow files
   - Validates GitHub Actions workflow syntax

### Setup Workflow

6. **deploy-cicd.yml** - Deploy CI/CD setup
   - Triggers: Manual dispatch only
   - One-time workflow to initialize CI/CD infrastructure
   - Sets up workspace configuration and secrets

## App Deployment

**Note**: The Databricks App is deployed automatically as part of the bundle deployment workflows above (via `app-resource.yml`).
No separate app deployment workflow is needed.

## Setup Instructions

To set up CI/CD for this project:
1. Refer to [Setting up CI/CD](<../../README.md#Setting up CI/CD>)
2. Follow the [MLOps Setup Guide](../../docs/mlops-setup.md)
3. Ensure `WORKFLOW_TOKEN` secret has `Workflow` permissions
4. Configure Azure service principal secrets for staging and prod:
   - `STAGING_AZURE_SP_TENANT_ID`
   - `STAGING_AZURE_SP_APPLICATION_ID`
   - `STAGING_AZURE_SP_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `PROD_AZURE_SP_TENANT_ID`
   - `PROD_AZURE_SP_APPLICATION_ID`
   - `PROD_AZURE_SP_CLIENT_SECRET`
