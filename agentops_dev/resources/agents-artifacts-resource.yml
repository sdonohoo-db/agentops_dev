  # NOTE: Model serving endpoint is NOT pre-created here
  # Following Databricks guidance: let agents.deploy() create and manage the endpoint
  # to avoid "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'served_entities'"
  # See: https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/deploy-agent.html
  #
  # The endpoint will be created by agents.deploy() in the AgentDeployment notebook
  # Permissions are set via agents.set_permissions() after deployment

  # NOTE: App definition has been moved to resources/app-resource.yml
  # The old dash-chatbot-app definition here is deprecated
